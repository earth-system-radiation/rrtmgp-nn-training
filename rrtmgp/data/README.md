# About spectral data

This directory contains _k_-distributions for use with RRTMGP. Files with names ending in `2018-12-04` are recommended for current scientific use. We are developing alternative _k_-distributions, using smaller numbers of _g_-points to reduce computational cost and memory usage, targeted to specific applications. Files with the `prototype` tag are a first iteration but are not meant for scientific application at this time.
